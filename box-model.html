		<h1>McKinsey 7S Framework</h1>
		<h2 class="link">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_7S_Framework">Click Here for the article.</a></h2>
						
		<p class="first">The <b>McKinsey 7S Framework</b> is a management model developed by well-known business consultants Robert H. Waterman, Jr. and Tom Peters (who also developed the MBWA-- "Management By Walking Around" motif, and authored <i>In Search of Excellence</i>) in the 1980s. This was a strategic vision for groups, to include businesses, business units, and teams. The 7S are structure, strategy, systems, skills, style, staff and shared values.</p>
		<p>The model is most often used as a tool to assess and monitor changes in the internal situation of an organization.</p>
		<p>The model is based on the theory that, for an organization to perform well, these seven elements need to be aligned and mutually reinforcing. So, the model can be used to help identify what needs to be realigned to improve performance, or to maintain alignment (and performance) during other types of change.</p>
		<p>Whatever the type of change – restructuring, new processes, organizational merger, new systems, change of leadership, and so on – the model can be used to understand how the organizational elements are interrelated, and so ensure that the wider impact of changes made in one area is taken into consideration.</p>
