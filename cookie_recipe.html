		<h2>Recipe taken from AllRecipes.com</h2>
		
		<p>This recipe is very adaptable as far as what and how much you add to the basic dough. I used a normal amount of chips, but this amount can be doubled without issue. You can also toss in dried fruit and nuts fearlessly.</p>
		
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
			<li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
			<li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1 1/8 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chip</li>
			<li>1/3 cup white chocolate chips</li>
			<li>1/3 cup milk chocolate</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Mash the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl with a spatula until creamy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla; whisk vigorously for 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
			<li>Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a small bowl; dump into the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Fold the semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips into the mixture. Arrange onto the prepared baking sheet using a small scoop or large spoon.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove from oven and allow to cool on the sheet for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.</li>
		</ol>
